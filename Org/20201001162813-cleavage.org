* Definition
Let \(P:E \rightarrow B\) be a functor. A /cleavage/ of \(p\) is a choice, for each \(e \in E\) and \(u : b \rightarrow Pe\), of a single [[file:20201001140349-grothendieck_fibrations.org][cartesian arrow]] \(f:e' \rightarrow e\) such that \(Pf = u\).
** Cloven functors
We say that a functor equipped with a cleavage is /cloven/.
** Normal cleavage
A cleavage is /normal/ if whenever \(u\) is the identity, the cartesian arrow \(f\) is the identity.
** Splitting cleavage
A cleavage is said to be /splitting/ if each composite \(f_1 f_2\) is the specified lifting of \(u_2 u_1\).
* Properties
** Grothendieck Fibration
If a cleavage exists for a functor \(P\), \(P\) is a [[file:20201001140349-grothendieck_fibrations.org][Grothendieck fibration]].
