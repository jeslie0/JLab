* Definitions
** Retracts
#+BEGIN_definition
 Suppose \(\mathcal C\) is a category. A map \(f\) is a /retract/ of a map \(g\) if \(f\) is a retract of \(g\) in \(\mathcal C ^\rightarrow\). That is, there is a commuting diagram of the following form:

 #+BEGIN_SRC latex :fit yes :file ../Images/retract-diagram.png :imagemagick yes :iminoptions -density 600  :headers '("\\usepackage{tikz-cd}") :results none
   \definecolor{col1}{HTML}{B2B2B2}
   \begin{tikzcd}[color=col1]
A \ar[r] \ar[d,"f"] & C \ar[r] \ar[d, "g"] & A \ar[d, "f"] \\
      B \ar[r] & D \ar[r] & B
   \end{tikzcd}

where the horizontal composites are identities.
#+END_definition

** Right/Left lifting properties

#+BEGIN_definition
 Let \(i : A \rightarrow B\) and \(p : X \rightarrow Y\) be two morphisms in a category \(\mathcal C\). We say that \(i\) has the /left lifting property/ with respect to \(p\) or that \(p\) has the right lifting property with respect to \(i\) if any commuting square of the following form has a diagonal filler:

 #+BEGIN_SRC latex :fit yes :file ../Images/leftrightliftingproperty.png :imagemagick yes :iminoptions -density 600  :headers '("\\usepackage{tikz-cd}") :results none
   \definecolor{col1}{HTML}{B2B2B2}
   \begin{tikzcd}[color=col1]
     A \arrow[r, "a"] \ar[d, "i"''] & X \ar[d, "p"]\\
     B \arrow[r, "b"''] \arrow[ur, "h", dashed] & Y
   \end{tikzcd}
   #+END_SRC
#+attr_html: :width 300px
[[file:../Images/leftrightliftingproperty.png]]

#+END_definition

We extend the above notion and say that a morphism \(p\) has the right (left) lifting property with respect to a class of morphisms \(\mathcal F\) if \(p\) has the left lifting property with respect to every morphism in \(\mathcal F\). We also denote \(r(\mathcal F)\) and \(l(\mathcal F)\) for the classes of morphisms with respectively the right and left lifting property with respect to every element in \(\mathcal F\).
** Stability
We say that a class of morphisms \(\mathcal F\) is stable under pushouts (retracts) if the pushout (any retract) of \(f \in \mathcal F\) is also in \(\mathcal F\).

#+BEGIN_definition
Let \(I\) be a well ordered set with initial element 0, viewed as a category. Let \(\mathcal F\) be a class of morphisms in a category \(\mathcal C\). Let \(X: I \rightarrow \mathcal C\) be a functor with the following properties: for all \(i \neq 0 \in I\), the colimit \(\colim_{j < i} X(j)\) is representable and the induced map
\[\colim_{j < i} X(j) \rightarrow X(i)\]
belongs to \(\mathcal F\). If the \(\colim_{i \in I} X(i)\) exists and the map \(X(0) \rightarrow \colim_{i \in I} X(i)\) belongs to \(\mathcal F\), then we say that \(\mathcal F\) is /stable under transfinite compositions/.
#+END_definition

#+BEGIN_definition
We say a class \(\mathcal F\) is /saturated/ if it is stable under retracts, pushouts and transfinite compositions.
#+END_definition
** Weak factorisation systems
#+BEGIN_definition
A /weak factorisation system/ in a category \(\mathcal C\) is a couple \((A,B)\) of classes of morphisms satisfying the following properties:
- Both \(A\) and \(B\) are stable under retracts;
- \(A \subset l(B)\), or equivalently \(B \subset r(A)\);
- any morphism \(f:X \rightarrow Y\) of \(\mathcal C\) admits a factorisation of the form \(f = pi\), with \(i \in A\) and \(p \in B\).
#+END_definition

We can form weak factorisation systems from the small object argument.

#+BEGIN_proposition
Let \(\mathcal C\) be a locally small category with small colimits and a small set of morphisms \(I\). Assume there exists a cardinal \(\kappa\) such that for any element \(i:K \rightarrow L\) of \(I\), the functor
\[\mathcal C(K,-): \mathcal C \rightarrow \textbf{Set}\]
commutes with colimits indexed by \(\kappa\)-filtered well ordered sets. Then \((l(r(I)), r(I))\) is a weak factorisation system. Furthermore, \(l(r(I))\) is the smallest saturated class containing \(I\).
#+END_proposition

#+BEGIN_corollary
Let \(\mathbb A\) be a small category and \(I\) a small set of morphisms of presheaves over \(\mathbb A\). Then the couple \((l(r(I)), r(I))\) is a weak factorisation system in \(\widehat{\mathbb A}\).
#+END_corollary

** Model Categories

#+BEGIN_definition
A /model category/ is a locally small category \(\mathcal C\) endowed with three classes of morphisms: weak equivalences \(W\), fibrations \(\Fib\) and cofibrations \(\Cof\), such that the following hold:
1. The category \(\mathcal C\) has small limits and colimits;
2. The class of weak equivalences satisfies 2-out-of-3;
3. Both couples \((\Cof, \Fib \cap W)\) and \((\Cof \cap W, \Fib)\) are weak factorisation systems.

* TODO Properties
#+BEGIN_proposition
Let \(\mathcal C\) be a category together with two classes of morphisms \(\mathcal F, \mathcal F '\). Then the following holds:

1) \(\mathcal F \subset r(\mathcal F')\) if and only if \(\mathcal F' \subset l(\mathcal F)\);
